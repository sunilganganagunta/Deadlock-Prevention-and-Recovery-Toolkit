# Deadlock-Prevention-and-Recovery-Toolkit
# 🔒 Deadlock Prevention and Recovery Toolkit

This project is designed to simulate and demonstrate **deadlock handling techniques in Operating Systems**, including **prevention, detection, avoidance, and recovery mechanisms**. It is ideal for students and developers who want to understand how processes compete for shared resources and how deadlocks can be managed in real systems.

## 📌 Features

- Simulates resource allocation among multiple processes  
- Demonstrates **deadlock scenarios** visually or through code logic  
- Implements:
  - Deadlock **Prevention**
  - Deadlock **Avoidance (Banker's Algorithm)**
  - Deadlock **Detection**
  - Deadlock **Recovery**
- Logs process execution and resource usage  
- Helps understand concurrency and synchronization
